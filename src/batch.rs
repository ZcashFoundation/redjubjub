//! Performs batch RedJubjub signature verification.
//!
//! Batch verification asks whether *all* signatures in some set are valid,
//! rather than asking whether *each* of them is valid. This allows sharing
//! computations among all signature verifications, performing less work overall
//! at the cost of higher latency (the entire batch must complete), complexity of
//! caller code (which must assemble a batch of signatures across work-items),
//! and loss of the ability to easily pinpoint failing signatures.
